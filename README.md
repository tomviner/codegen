# codegen

A minimalistic library which allows the decompilation of python ASTs back to python code.

The primary goal of this library is to be light-weight. It can be used in any project just by
including codegen.py in the project folder and it has no dependencies outside of the sys and ast
modules. Next to this it also can perform line-number accurate decompilation.

For a more powerful alternative, take a look at [astor](http://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor).

The library is able to correctly round-trip the python standard library for Python 2.6 up to 3.7.
